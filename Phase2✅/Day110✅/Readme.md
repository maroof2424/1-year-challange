### ðŸ“˜ Syntax Examples

Assume we have two tables:

**Customers**

| customer\_id | name  |
| ------------ | ----- |
| 1            | Ali   |
| 2            | Sana  |
| 3            | Usman |

**Orders**

| order\_id | customer\_id | product |
| --------- | ------------ | ------- |
| 101       | 1            | Book    |
| 102       | 2            | Laptop  |
| 103       | 1            | Pen     |

### ðŸ”¹ LEFT JOIN

```sql
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.product
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;
```

ðŸ”¸ **Output:** All customers, even those with no orders.

---

### ðŸ”¹ RIGHT JOIN

FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;
```

ðŸ”¸ **Output:** All orders, even if the customer is missing (rare case).

---

### ðŸ”¹ FULL JOIN

```sql
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.product
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;
```

ðŸ”¸ **Output:** All customers and all orders (matched and unmatched).

---

### ðŸ”¹ CROSS JOIN

```sql
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.product
FROM Customers
CROSS JOIN Orders;
```

ðŸ”¸ **Output:** Every customer paired with every product.

---

### ðŸ”¹ SELF JOIN

SELECT A.name AS Customer1, B.name AS Customer2
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.customer_id <> B.customer_id;
